insert combinatoric optimization problems

* Assignment problem:
 Assign n agents to m tasks, in such a way that the total cost of n-m assigments is minimized
 This can be chefs to recipe/kitchen assignments

* Maximum flow problem:
 A graph representing with edges representing flow, and flow being conserved at vertices. Edges have maximum flows. Find the edge weights that maximize/minimize flow.
 Hallways can restrict individuals. Trampling can occur if the max flow is exceeded.

* Closure problem:
 Set of vertices in a directed graph such that the total vertex weight is maximized, and the edges do not leave the set.
 IDK yet

* Knapsack problem:
 A set of items have a weight and value. Choose a subset that maximizes value but doesn't exceed total weight.
 This can be the act of buying literally anything.

* Nurse scheduling problem:
 Select shifts of employees that satisfy hard and soft constraints. Two employees may hate each other.

* Minimum spanning tree problem:
 A minimal tree with a graph such that the total edge weights are minimized.
 Manager positions?

* Set cover problem:
 Find the minimal subset of sets that cover the universe.
 This can be skills for repairmen. Since several repairmen with the same skills will have no benefit.

* Job-shop scheduling problem:
 N machines must do M tasks. The machines each go different speeds, and the tasks take different amounts of time.
 Customers can preorder in bulk, which must be carefully scheduled.

* Vehicle routing problem:
 Optimal routes for a set of vehicles to deliver to a set of customers.
 Route trucks to distribution centers for ingredients. Vehicles can break down, so allow rerouting of other vehicles to assist. :3

* Bin packing problem:
 Fit sized items in sized bins, minimizing number of bins used.
 This can be truck packing. Or ingredient packing. Pay big money for extra bins?

* Talent scheduling problem:
 Actors will be paid for a continuous number of days, and must be in their needed scenes. Rearrange the scene order (scene per day) to minimize cost of actors.
 This can be fancy chefs.
